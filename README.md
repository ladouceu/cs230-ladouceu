# cs230-ladouceu
Repo for final project of Stanford course in Deep Learning: CS230

## to do
priorities
- make a siamese network that works just with th images [done]
- make my siamese network train in parallel
- add current position to my data in siamese model (this requires that I use the next step as my positive and negative but different ids and same video, maybe use the closest images as examples for negative)
- then test out my model by submitting my results to MOTchallenge (requires that I build a whole new pipeline)
less critical
- improve the pipeline as suggested in the todo (using the experimental)
- try to add the 4 last location as features
- try to add the lstm for location
