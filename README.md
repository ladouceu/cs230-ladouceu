Repo for final project of Stanford course in Deep Learning: CS230

## data
In this project, the training and testing data is taken from MOTChallenge, more specifically MOT16, and can be found here: [MOT16.zip](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT16.zip). Simply download and unzip the file to use.

## model weights
The models developed in this project were trained and the model weights were stored here: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CmjQvYgoPTaBEDTZYxtY2geJ_u1MPJQm?usp=sharing)

## environment
These notebooks were run in Google Colab Pro in the Python3 environment with GPU and High-Ram usage (2021-11-28). 

## code
The code for this project consists of 3 main notebooks: train_siamese_model, produce_test_tracking, visualize_test_tracking. The other notebooks found in under 'archive/' are messy development notebooks.

### note
All the paths used in these notebooks are relative paths that need to be updated for your environment if you are to use these notebooks.
